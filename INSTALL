JayBeams does not have any releases yet, so you probably cloned the
git repository.  You should first get the dependencies for JayBeams,
which include (at least): autoconf, automake,
autoconf-archive (>= 2015.02.24), make, clang (>= 3.5),
Boost (>= 1.55), YAML-CPP, Skye, FFTW3, OpenCL, clFFT, Boost.Compute.

More detailed install instructions are in the doc/setup.dox document
for both Fedora and Ubuntu.  The Travis-CI configuration script a good
place to find all details on how to install the dependencies.

$ ./bootstrap
$ mkdir build ; cd build
$ CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS=-O3 ../configure
$ make
$ make check

Once we have releases the configure script will be bundled with the
release tarball and you can use:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
